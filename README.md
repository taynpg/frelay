# frelay

A tool that uses a relay server to upload and download files from remote clients.

## Features

1. Minimal configuration—simply start a server, connect to it, and begin transferring files.
2. If you frequently transfer the same files repeatedly, frelay offers a local-remote file mapping feature for one-click transfers.

## Disclaimer And Warning
This tool is solely designed for simple file transmission between clients via a relay server. It does not include any security validation logic to prevent data attacks or similar threats. It is primarily intended for temporary, non-sensitive file transfers. Please close the software or disconnect from the relay server when not in use.

The software may contain unexpected bugs that could corrupt or lose your files. Please ensure proper backups or use it only for non-critical file transfers.
